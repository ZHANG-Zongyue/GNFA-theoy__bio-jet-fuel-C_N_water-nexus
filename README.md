The general theory of nitrogen flow accounting, theory-based N flow database (in the planet-generalized version), and ternary N flow sustainability indicators calculation code merged into the parametric LCA model of maize straw gasification derived bio-jet fuel supply chain under the Chinese context. It also includes related files needed to simulate the parametric LCA model built in the paper 'The general theory of nitrogen flow accounting and theory-based database &amp; indicators: an application on the study of carbon, water, nitrogen flow nexus of maize straw gasification derived bio-jet fuel supply chain in China' as well as corresponding Supplementary Information files of the paper.
